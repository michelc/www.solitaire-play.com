          <a href="/thebog/">TheBOG</a> is a daily word game inspired by Boggle
          that's played on a grid of 16 letters arranged on a 4 by 4 board.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/labog/labog-grille.png" title="TheBOG : starting grid" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p class="notes">
          For now, TheBOG is a <b>weekly</b> game, with a new game every Wednesday.
          <!--
          This article explains the game rules in detail. For instructions on
          how to play, you can also refer to
          <a href="mode-emploi-labog.html" title="How to use TheBOG">TheBOG User Manual</a>.
          -->
        </p>

        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>

        <p>
          The goal of TheBOG is to find as many words as possible by connecting
          adjacent cells on the board, either horizontally, vertically, or
          diagonally.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the beginning of the game, 16 letters are placed on the game grid.
          These letters are the same for all players and make up the daily grid.
          You have a full day to participate in this game. The letter are
          updated at midnight UTC, which corresponds to 1 am (winter time) or 2
          am (summer time) in France.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using these 16 letters, you can start searching for words that are
          present on the grid, similar to Boggle. To do this, you must form
          words by connecting adjacent letters. Cells can be connected if they
          "touch" either horizontally (left or right), vertically (above or
          below), or even diagonally. It's important to note that a cell cannot
          be used more than once in the same word.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Rules</h2>

        <p>
          For a word to be valid, it must meet certain conditions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>It must be at least 4 letters long</li>
          <li>It cannot exceed 9 letters</li>
          <li>It must be listed in the accepted words</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          TheBOG only accepts words from the
          <a href="https://github.com/Fj00/CEL">Common English Lexicon (CEL)</a>.
          Verbs and conjugations are allowed, but proper nouns are not accepted.
          To make things more challenging, each daily TheBOG game includes at
          least one word with 8 or 9 letters!
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/labog/labog-lettres.png" title="TheBOG : first word with 8 letters" alt="" />
        </p>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>

        <p>
          TheBOG automatically keeps track of the number of words found and
          calculates their scores. Finding a 4-letter word is worth 1 point.
          Words with more than 4 letters earn 1 point per letter:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>4 letters => 1 point</li>
          <li>5 letters => 5 points</li>
          <li>6 letters => 6 points</li>
          <li>7 letters => 7 points</li>
          <li>8 letters => 8 points</li>
          <li>9 letters => 9 points</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The score, not the number of words, determines the level achieved in
          the game. The objective in TheBOG is to reach the "Genius" level,
          which requires scoring around 60% of the total possible points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Typically, the "Genius" level is attainable with a good "everyday"
          vocabulary, without the need for rare words.
        </p>

        <p>
          Theoretically, the difficulty of each daily game progresses throughout
          the week, starting from easiest to most difficult:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Easy game on Monday</li>
          <li>Slightly less easy game on Tuesday</li>
          <li>Moderate game on Wednesday</li>
          <li>Fairly average game on Thursday</li>
          <li>Somewhat more challenging game on Friday</li>
          <li>Difficult game on Saturday</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The week concludes with another moderately challenging game on Sunday.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          I hope this documentation has helped you understand the basic rules
          for <a href="/thebog/">playing TheBOG</a>. So... good luck and have
          fun!
