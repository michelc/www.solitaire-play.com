          / Free Monte Carlo Solitaire
        </h1>

        <p>
          Last month, Solitaire-Play get a new game:
          <a href="/monte-carlo/">Monte Carlo Solitaire</a>. It's not a patience
          with a lot of strategy but it's easy and restful to play.
        </p>

        <p>
          Monte Carlo is a pair matching solitaire and uses only one standard
          deck of 52 playing cards. At the beginning of the game, 25 cards are
          dealt in a five by five grid. The remaining cards forms a face-down
          Stock pile on the side.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/monte-carlo-1.png" title="Monte Carlo: playing cards" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of Monte Carlo is to remove all cards that make up a pair:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Two cards with the same rank, regardless of suit (like two Sevens or
            two Queens)
          </li>
          <li>
            Which are adjacent to each other (either horizontally, vertically or
            diagonally).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/monte-carlo-2.png" title="Monte Carlo: making pair" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          When no more pairs are possible, you have to “redeal” cards to
          continue the game:
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/monte-carlo-3.png" title="Monte Carlo: redeal cards" alt="" />
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Cards from the Tableau are “consolidated”. They move from right to
            left and up from the lower rows to fill in the gaps left behind by
            the removed pairs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additional cards are dealt from the Stock to complete the 5x5 grid.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/monte-carlo-4.png" title="Monte Carlo: continue game" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Stock is empty, the redeal only remove empty spaces. The game
          continues until all cards moved to the Foundation (you win) or ends
          when there are no more pairs (game over).
        </p>

        <p>
          Monte Carlo Solitaire is a fairly easy patience to get in. You match
          cards by rank (2 cards with the same “value”) and position (2 cards
          which “touch” each other). It's also a solitaire playable by children
          who can find matches and redeal cards when all possible pairs are
          done.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite its name, this solitaire has no connection to the city from
          Monaco, nor to any casino related game. It's only a free solitaire
          sometime known as “Double and Quits”, “Weddings”, “Good Neighbors” or
          “Quits”...
        </p>

        <p>
          Over all, Monte Carlo is a quick solitaire game to learn, to play and
          sometime to win, mostly by luck but a bit of concentration can help.
          So, give this catchy little solitaire a few minutes of your free time
          and let's play <a href="/monte-carlo/">Monte Carlo Solitaire</a>
          online...
