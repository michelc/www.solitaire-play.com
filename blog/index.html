        <h2>Free Alaska Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          Alaska is another variant of Yukon and Russian Solitaire, with a small
          variation to Tableau building rules. It's definitively a game to
          compete if you like challenges.

        <h2>Online FreeCell Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          The famous logic puzzle in the form of a solitaire card game. No
          hidden cards, no luck involved, a lot of thinking and every game
          should be winnable...

        <h2>Free Pyramid Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          A classic pair-removal game with a triangular tableau and very simple
          rules. Pyramid is easy to get and perfect to kill a few minutes. Also
          known as Tut's Tomb, King Tut or Treize.

        <h2>Free Canfield Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          An old solitaire game with a whole legend behind him. Canfield is a
          solitaire as popular as Klondike, but requires a lot of planning. If
          you want to tackle a new patience card game, it deserves a chance.

        <h2>Free Russian Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          Russian is a “simple” variant of Yukon Solitaire, with a different
          Tableau building rule. It needs a lot more attention and strategy to
          succeed. But it's more rewarding each time you win a game.

        <h2>Free Yukon Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          Yukon is another classic solitaire card game, just like its popular
          “cousin” Klondike but with some extra rules. With all cards dealed and
          no Stock pile, you will have to rack your brain to win and improve
          your game.

        <h2>Free Aces Up Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a little late, but a few words to introduce a new solitaire game
          that I added at the beginning of the year. Aces Up is a popular
          solitaire, it doesn't need a big space and it is easy peasy to play.

        <h2>Free Monte Carlo Solitaire</h2>
        <p>
          Solitaire-Play turns three years... This time, I added a new kind of
          solitaire. Even if “Monte Carlo” is more a pair matching card game
          than a classic solitaire, do not miss this catchy little game.
        </p>

        <h2>Free Klondike Turn Three</h2>
        <p>
          Solitaire-Play turns two years this summer! I always procrastinated,
          but it's really time to release the Klondike “Turn Three” version...
          It wasn't difficult to develop the code, but a lot harder to win the
          game.

        <h3>Free Cruel Solitaire</h3>
        <p>
          One of my favourites solitaire game is Cruel. Klondike is easy to
          start, Golf is fast to play, but Cruel is really addictive to win.
          You have to try this game if you want to train your concentration
          and challenge your perseverance.

        <h3>Another hamburger menu</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, Solitaire-Play website offers only two card games: the
          classic Klondike solitaire and a Golf solitaire. But I expect to
          create more solitaire games this year.

        <h3>Play solitaire on phone</h3>
        <p>
          When you play Golf on phone, in portrait mode, game over dialog hides
          cards on the Foundation. As you can't see the last draw, you can't be
          sure your last move was the good one.

        <h3>Free Golf Solitaire</h3>
        <p>
          A little over a year after the release of Klondike Solitaire online,
          I finally find enough time to code another solitaire card game. So,
          let's play Golf, like the one in Microsoft Entertainment Pack for
          Windows.

        <h3>Free Klondike Solitaire</h3>
        <p>
          Back in the old days of Visual Basic 3, I used to create some games.
          Mainly solitaire card games. Today, with HTML and JavaScript I do it
          again!
