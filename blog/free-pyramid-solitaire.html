          This post is a little late. I should have written it before the post
          for Canfield, since it turns out that <a href="/pyramid/">Pyramid
          Solitaire</a> was programmed first.
          But I chose to take my time and wait to finish
          <a href="/pyramid-turn-three/">Pyramid Turn Three</a> variant.
          Then I was looking for the help file of the game
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_(card_game)">Tut's
          Tomb</a> released with  Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          And so, without further ado, I can simply pick up much of the original
          documentation provided by Microsoft at the time.
        </p>

        <h2>Playing the Game</h2>

        <p>
          The object of Pyramid Solitaire is to remove all the cards in the
          pyramid by pairing cards where ranks add up to 13. Kings may be
          removed individually.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Note</u>: The rank of a card is it's numerical value. An Ace has a
          rank o 1, a 2 card has a rank of 2... Jacks have a rank of 11, Queens
          of 12, and Kings of 13.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>To Deal a new Hand:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Click the “GAME” menu. Or press F2.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>To Match 2 Cards:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Move the cursor over the cards. When it is over a free card, it will
            look like a hand. Otherwise, it will look like an arrow. Click the
            desired card, and it will be highlighted. Then click on a second
            free card. If the two cards equal 13, they will move to the top
            right corner. Otherwise, the highlighted card will be restored and
            you must choose a new pair of cards.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <u>Note</u>: A free card is one which has no other cards lying on top
          of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>To Turn Over Cards in the Deck:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Click the down-turned deck. A card or cards will be turned face up.
            You can match these cards just like cards in the pyramid.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <u>Note</u>: One or three cards will be turned face up depending on
          what variant you play (Pyramid Turn One or Pyramid Turn Three).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>To Turn Over the Deck:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            After all cards have been turned face-up, they can be flipped over
            and re-used. Click the green “plus” sign to turn over the deck.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Pyramid Solitaire begins with a shuffled deck and 28 cards dealt in a
            pyramid shape on the screen. The rest of the cards are placed
            face-down in the top left corner.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may play any free card, or any card that will be made free by
            removing the card you have just selected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cards are removed by matching two cards whose ranks add up to 13.
            Kings are removed individually.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cards from the remaining deck may be used to make a match of 13. Only
            the card on top of the turned-over stack may be played.
          </li>
          <li>
            You win when all the cards in the pyramid have been removed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Strategy and Hints</h2>

        <p>
          This section contains helpful hints for playing Pyramid Solitaire
          successfully.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If more than one match option is available for a card, consider your
            choices carefully. If you can remove a card that will free up
            another much needed card, this is probably your best move.
          </li>
          <li>
            Match the cards in the pyramid before resorting to the deck cards.
            You may need those cards later when matching from the pyramid is
            more difficult.
          </li>
        </ul>
