          / Free Klondike Turn Three
        </h1>

        <p>
          Two years ago, I started Solitaire-Play with the “Turn One” variant of
          Klondike Solitaire. It's a classic game and my favorite version, the
          one I used to play on Windows. You know it's already difficult to win
          with a single draw. I don't feel the challenge to turn three cards at
          a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I understand it's just my opinion and that it's finally time to
          launch another solitaire. This summer, I took a few hours to create a
          new Klondike “Turn Three”. Some months ago, I had improved my CSS
          files to better represent all kind of card stacks. And now, with one
          extra CSS rule, I succeed to display the Waste pile as a fan of three
          cards.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/klondike-turn-three.png" title="Klondike Turn Three online" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          I “just” have to work on the JavaScript part to manage the turn three
          version. The obvious concern was the draw code, to take three cards or
          one, according to which Klondike is played. But in fact, the big
          problem was to handle the undo system. After a three draw, all 3 cards
          must return to the deck when the player chose to cancel his last move.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, I had to update the hint system. I keep it simple and I only
          change the way of playing a “2” card. With Klondike Turn One, I never
          suggest to play a “2” from the Waste to the Tableau:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            This kind of move may block the underlying “3” when I will need it
            to build a Foundation. Or to play another “2” already on the
            Tableau.
          </li>
          <li>
            The “2” will always be available when I will go through the full
            deck.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          But with Klondike Turn Three, it become a more interesting move:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            It's not sure the “2” will always be available on top of three cards
            the next time we go through the Stock.
          </li>
          <li>
            By removing a card from the deck, we will get to see different cards
            on top of the Waste in the next round.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Et voila! I hope this small improvement will please people who prefer
          <a href="/klondike-turn-three/">Klondike Turn Three</a>. And that
          players who like the classic <a href="/">Klondike Turn One</a> will
          give it a try.
