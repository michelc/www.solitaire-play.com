          / Free Golf Solitaire
        </h1>

        <p>
          <a href="/golf/">Golf</a> is one of the oldest forms of solitaire
          card games. It was called One Foundation and I first play it from the
          game developed by Ken Sykes for Microsoft Entertainment Pack. It was
          actually the first game I ever created with Visual Basic 3 (after some
          kinds of Breakout and Pong for Apple II).
        </p>

        <p>
          Golf Solitaire is played with a single pack of 52 playing cards. Like
          <a href="/">Klondike Solitaire</a>, the game starts with a Tableau
          where seven columns of cards are dealt. Except this time, each stack
          contains five cards and all cards are face up.
        </p>

        <p>
          The remaining cards forms a Stock in the bottom left and the first one
          is turned over to start the Foundation. And now, our goal is to send
          all the cards from the Tableau to the Foundation.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/golf-layout.png" title="Golf: card layout" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          We can move the top card from any of the seven stacks to the
          Foundation. It must be either one higher or one lower in rank than
          the top card on the Foundation, regardless of suit.
        </p>

        <p>
          So in the above example, either the ace of hearts or the 3 of spades
          may be built on the 2 of spades.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Ace is one lesser than 2 and we can play one heart over one spade.
          </li>
          <li>
            3 is one greater than the current card in the Foundation and we
            don't care that they are both spades.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Then, if we played the 3 of spades, it may be followed by the 4 of
          clubs from the second column. 4 is one greater than 3 and suit doesn't
          matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Changes of direction are allowed at any time. Thus we can play the
          3 of clubs from the last column (which is now on top as we first
          moved the 3 of spades) over the 4 of clubs. So far, we played the
          following sequence: 2, 3, 4, 3 which is totally valid.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/golf-foundation.png" title="Golf: Foundation build" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's build the 2 of clubs then the ace of hearts.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the strict form of Golf, we can only move twos on aces, kings are
          only allowed on queens and we can't play nothing on kings. With this
          rule, it's quite impossible to win (unless you keep playing all day
          long).
        </p>

        <p>
          Solitaire-Play uses the variant where sequences may turn the corner:
          we can play kings on aces and aces on kings. With this change, game
          become a little more rewarding.
        </p>

        <p>
          To follow with our current game, we can now play either the king of
          spades or the king of hearts over the ace of hearts.
        </p>

        <p>
          The king of hearts is a better choice, because it shows the ace of
          clubs. So we can build this ace then the king of spades.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/golf-king-ace.png" title="Golf: kings on aces and aces on kings" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          After our last move, no more card from the Tableau can be played to
          the Foundation. We have to deal another card from the Stock and try to
          resume the building.
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/golf-stock.png" title="Golf: one more card from the Stock" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Jack of hearts! We are lucky. Now we can play:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            3 cards: 10 of hearts, jack of spades and queen of hearts.
          </li>
          <li>
            8 cards: 10 of hearts, jack of spades, 10 of diamonds, 9 of clubs,
            10 of spades, jack of diamonds, queen of hearts, jack of clubs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's better to play cards that will allow for long streaks of play
          (but there are some exceptions).
        </p>

        <p>
          You win the game when all cards in the Tableau have been built to the
          Foundation. The game is over when the Stock is empty and no more moves
          are possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Game after game, you'll understand that it's quite difficult to win.
          There will always be some cards on the Tableau. And since win is
          unusual, your goal is to finish the game with the fewest cards
          possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rules are easy. Play may seem a little bit mechanical. But it becomes
          exciting when you play more on instinct. Once you get to see the game,
          the moves ahead, you can fully enjoy a fast paced and very fun game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't take my words for it. Try it yourself and go put your luck and
          patience to the test by playing <a href="/golf/">Golf Solitaire
          online</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          And remember, it's a responsive game like Klondike Solitaire. You can
          play it for free with phone, tablet or desktop!
