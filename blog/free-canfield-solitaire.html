        <h2>The story behind the game</h2>

        <p>
          According to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canfield_(solitaire)">Wikipedia</a>,
          the legend says that Richard A. Canfield was a famous gambler and
          owner of the Canfield Casino in Saratoga Springs, New York during the
          1890s.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gamblers at his casino played a solitaire game by “buying” a deck of
          cards for $50 and earning $5 for each card they managed to place in
          the Foundations. If one was fortunate enough to place all 52 cards
          into the Foundations, the player would win $500.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although players make a loss (about an average of five to six cards),
          the game proved to be popular, and Canfield became rich...
        </p>

        <p>
          Some people think that the game played in Canfield's casino was
          Klondike Solitaire. In fact, Richard Canfield himself call the game
          Klondike. In “The Official Rules of Card Games” from 1897, the
          description of Canfield matches exactly to the rule of Klondike.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/canfield/">Canfield</a> is also known as “Demon” or “Demon
          Thirteen” in UK and Ireland. There is also an easier variant,
          “Storehouse”, where the four Two are used to start each Foundation.
          Then Foundations build upward in suit up to the aces.
        </p>

        <h2>The setup of the game</h2>

        <p>
          Canfield Solitaire is played with one standard pack of 52 playing
          cards.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            You first reserve thirteen cards face down. The top card of this
            Reserve is then turn face up and available to play.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Tableau contains four columns, with one card available to play
            in each pile.
          </li>
          <li>
            A card is played on the first Foundation. Then, the other
            Foundations will have to start with a card of the same rank.
          </li>
          <li>
            The remaining cards form a face down Stock pile on the left side.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/canfield-game.png" title="Canfield new game" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          The game starts by turning one or three cards from the Stock to the
          Waste. As always, your goal is to move all cards onto the four
          Foundations.
        </p>

        <h2>The rules of the game</h2>

        <p>
          You can play a card, provided two conditions:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The card is face up.</li>
          <li>It has to be the top card of its pile (Tableau, Reserve or Waste).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To start a Foundation, a card must have the same rank as the first
          card on the first Foundation. A card can go to a Foundation when it's
          the “next” card in the same suite. For example, if the Foundation
          started with a 7, the order of the cards will be: 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q,
          K, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can move a card in a Tableau pile, provided it's the “previous”
          card but in alternate color. Thus, a red 9 goes on a black 10 and a
          black King can go on a red Ace.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also move an entire Tableau pile onto another pile, as long
          as the bottom card from the moved pile is the “previous” of the target
          pile.
        </p>

        <p>
          As soon as one Tableau column becomes empty, this pile is filled by
          the top card of the Reserve. When the Reserve is exhausted, you can
          move any playable card on this empty pile.
        </p>

        <p>
          When no more moves are possible, you deal one or three cards from the
          Stock to the Waste before continuing the game. When the Stock is
          exhausted, the Waste is flipped over to become a new Stock.
        </p>

        <h2>The chances of winning the game</h2>

        <p>
          In M. Canfield's casino, winning was unlikely. One player could manage
          to place an average of five to six cards to the Foundations without
          re-deal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jan Wolter wrote a solver and ran it on 50,000 random Canfield deals.
          It shown that between 71% and 72% of all games are possible to win
          (cf. <a href="https://politaire.com/article/canfield.html">Experimental
          Analysis of Canfield Solitaire</a>). For strategic expert-level
          players, the highest potential win rates is around 35%. For casual
          players, the win rate averages at about 15%.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's a little easier to win with unlimited re-deal... but it also
          depends on whether cards are dealt one or three at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, Canfield is another interesting variation compared to the
          familiar Klondike, which deserves a chance to be played. It's easy
          enough to master and the addition of a Reserve pile brings an extra
          level of pondering. Try <a href="/canfield/">Canfield Solitaire</a> or
          <a href="/canfield-turn-three/">Canfield Turn Three</a> online if you
          want to tackle a new patience card game.
