          / Free Klondike Solitaire
        </h1>

        <p>
          Hello, I am Michel and I created Solitaire-Play. Twenty years ago, I
          had already written a few games with Visual Basic 3. The first was
          <a href="/golf/">Golf</a>, because it's a solitaire card game with no
          drag &amp; drop to manage. Today, with HTML and JavaScript I should be
          able to do it again!
        </p>

        <p>
          This time, I choose to code a Klondike Solitaire game, because it's
          probably the best known solitaire in the world. Thus, everyone
          should know its rules and can start to play immediately for free...
        </p>

        <p class="play">
          <img src="../img/klondike-solitaire.png" title="Klondike Solitaire online" alt="" />
        </p>

        <p>
          For fun (and because I'm used to it), I tried to copy the game play
          from Windows Solitaire:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use drag &amp; drop to move cards from one pile to another</li>
          <li>Click on the Stock to draw a new card</li>
          <li>Double-click or right-click on a card to add it to a Foundation</li>
          <li>Right-click on the background to move all possible cards to the Foundations</li>
          <li>Allow unlimited undo to try different moves</li>
          <li>Accept the same keyboard shortcuts (F2, H and Control+Z)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I wanted to play solitaire online on a tablet (and maybe phone).
          So I use a responsive design to make the display part. I didn't want
          to go with Bootstrap and just made it basic by following a really
          <a href="http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid/">simple guide to responsive
          design</a> by Adam Kaplan. There are 7 piles in the Klondike Solitaire
          game, so I just build a 7 columns grid.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was a little worried, but finally the JavaScript part wasn't too
          hard. Basically, I'm not a real JavaScript developer, but thanks to
          <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and
          <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>, I was able to code
          quite easily. I found <a href="http://touchpunch.furf.com/">jQuery UI
          Touch Punch</a> by Dave Furfero so that drag &amp; drop also works on
          tablets. It's not perfect, but it's a good start.
        </p>

        <p>
          For cards, I also made it simple and used
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vector-cards/">Vectorized
          Playing Cards</a> by Chris Aguilar, and some graphics from
          <a href="http://svg-cards.sourceforge.net/">SVG-cards</a> by David
          Bellot.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have not used 52 images (one per card), but rather a single grid of
          images. That was pretty easy because I had already used this technique
          through the article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/sprites">CSS
          Sprites: Image Slicing’s Kiss of Death</a> by Dave Shea. Once my
          sprite was ready, <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a> was useful
          to optimize its size.
        </p>

        <p>
          After coding the game, I played with it to debug. A lot. Then I
          bought a domain name and here we are, with yet another <a href="/"
          title="Play Solitaire">free online solitaire game</a>!
        </p>

        <p>
          And remember, it's a responsive game. You can play Klondike Solitaire
          with phone, tablet or desktop!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have questions or comments about the game, feel free to contact
          me at the email "michel.c at gmail".
